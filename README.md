// Peer Review: I find the design of the site to be simple, yet extremely effective. It works really well, and everything is displayed in an orderly manner. It's also very responsive, impressively so. And the favorites bar was super cool, implemented very well. The only two problems I had were that the evolutions are not displayed properly, and there is not an obvious imdication as to how to toggle between the image of a pokemon's normal and shiny form (which is done by clicking on the image, but some sort of indication would further help streamline the experience of the website). Overall, an incredible job with the site, even with its simplicity.
